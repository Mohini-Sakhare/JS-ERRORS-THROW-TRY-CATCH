## JavaScript Errors Throw and Try to Catch

JavaScript uses throw to create custom errors and try...catch to handle them, preventing the program from crashing.
The finally block ensures that code runs after error handling, regardless of success or failure.

* throw: Creates custom errors and stops code execution.
* try...catch: Catches and handles errors to prevent crashes.
* finally: Runs code after try and catch, regardless of errors.
* Custom Errors: Create custom error types by extending the Error class.

try {
    dadalert("Welcome!");
}
catch (err) {
    console.log(err);
}

output:
ReferenceError: dadalert is not defined

In the above code, we make use of 'dadalert' which is not a reserved keyword 
and is neither defined hence we get the error.  

error.  

Syntax
The try statement allows you to check whether a specific block of code contains an error or not. 
The catch statement allows you to display the error if any are found in the try block.

try {
     Try Block to check for errors.
}
catch(err) {
      Catch Block to display errors.
}
